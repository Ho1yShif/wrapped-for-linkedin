# TODO

- Make the blue outline on cards on hover consistent across sections
  - Make it instantaneous with no fade delay
- Move the metrics under `Top posts` into the `Your year at a glance` section
	- Also move tiles (Total impressions, Members Reached, likes/comments/shares) under `Your year at a glance`
	- Make the `Year at a glance` section more prominent and similar to the `Top posts` section
- Show the top 6 posts in the `Top posts` section for a cleaner 2x3 grid
- Remove explicit ordering for top posts section and use the same ordering in the spreadsheet since it's already sorted by engagements
- Unify design so that `Top posts` and `Top demographics` have similar card styles with color outlines on hover not movement
- Bonus: Show mini calendar of follower activity
- Ensure polars join for weird top posts format is optimized
- Optimize Polars parsing speed
- Add option: Don't have LinkedIn creator mode?
	- Steps to turn on creator mode
	- View stats for Shifra Williams instead of your own page
- Cache previoulsy uploaded LinkedIn analytics files in local storage for faster loading and show an indicator that the data is from a previous upload with an upload date
- Consider changing to the wide bow image that wraps the entire LinkedIn Wrapped text for a fun and cozy design
