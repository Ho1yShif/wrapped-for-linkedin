# TODO

- Show one piece of information at a time and make it sharable like Spotify wrapped
- Consolidate card gradient as main gradient
- Cache previously uploaded LinkedIn analytics files in local storage for faster loading and show an indicator that the data is from a previous upload with an upload date
- Remove explicit ordering for top posts section and use the same ordering in the spreadsheet since it's already sorted by engagements
