# TODO

- Need to change total impressions lower card to new followers
- Zack's feedback:
	- Don’t light up cards on hover
	- Make top posts cards clickable
	- Align all cards
	- Things shouldn’t pretend to be clickable
	- Remove blue outlines if not clickable
- Remove explicit ordering for top posts section and use the same ordering in the spreadsheet since it's already sorted by engagements
- Bonus: Show mini calendar of follower activity
- Ensure polars join for weird top posts format is optimized
- Optimize Polars parsing speed
- Add option: Don't have LinkedIn creator mode?
	- Steps to turn on creator mode
	- View stats for Shifra Williams instead of your own page
- Cache previoulsy uploaded LinkedIn analytics files in local storage for faster loading and show an indicator that the data is from a previous upload with an upload date
